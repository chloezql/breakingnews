When I learnt where Erin died, honestly, I do wonder what actually happened that night. My captain is not the most responsible person, you know?"

        content: "Hi, I'm the exhibition director here. The day before the exhibition, I got a strange email from her. She urgently asked us to remove her mentor's name from her artist bio and all the credits. It was really unusual, since her mentor seemed very excited about it before. Honestly, it caught us off guard, having to adjust things so suddenly right before the opening."

        content: "Hey, um, I'm the one living next door to Erin's dorm. That night—the night Erin died—I heard Erin arguing with someone pretty loudly. It sounded serious, like stuff was being thrown around the room or slammed on the floor. Honestly, I couldn't hear clearly who she was yelling at, but it definitely sounded intense."
